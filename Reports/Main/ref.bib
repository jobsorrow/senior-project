	title = {A micro electromagnetic generator for vibration energy harvesting},
	abstract = {Vibration energy harvesting is receiving a considerable amount of interest as a means for powering wireless sensor nodes. This paper presents a small (component volume 0.1 cm3, practical volume 0.15 cm3) electromagnetic generator utilizing discrete components and optimized for a low ambient vibration level based upon real application data. The generator uses four magnets arranged on an etched cantilever with a wound coil located within the moving magnetic field. Magnet size and coil properties were optimized, with the final device producing 46 µW in a resistive load of 4 kΩ from just 0.59 m s−2 acceleration levels at its resonant frequency of 52 Hz. A voltage of 428 mVrms was obtained from the generator with a 2300 turn coil which has proved sufficient for subsequent rectification and voltage step-up circuitry. The generator delivers 30% of the power supplied from the environment to useful electrical power in the load. This generator compares very favourably with other demonstrated examples in the literature, both in terms of normalized power density and efficiency.}

abstract = {This paper deals with analyzing losses of three-phase high current and low voltage inverter, which is intended for automotive applications. High current inverters are becoming more popular in automotive area due to increasing the number of high power electrical drives in cars and trucks. The less reliable and less efficient, usually mechanical drive systems are replaced for more effective and more reliable electrical drive systems. There are liquid pumps, HVAC blowers, turbochargers, etc. Total losses of the common inverters are divided into three main parts, conductive and joule losses, switching losses and additional losses. The highest part of losses usually generates power switches, in this case MOSFETs. The size of other part of losses is determined by parameters of used components, i.e. DC-link capacitors, shunt resistor sensors, etc. The power losses and efficiency of inverter are analyzed by using the simulation model in LTspice. The model of inverter contains spice models of MOSEFTs and DC-link capacitors. The parasitic components of high current and excitation traces are also included into model. The analyzed inverter contains only DC-link shunt resistor for current sensing purpose in order to minimize joule losses of shunt resistors. Joule losses of shunt resistor, DC-link capacitor losses, reverse polarity battery protection MOSFET and three-phase half-bridge inverter are analyzed from power losses and efficiency point of view. The final result of this paper describes the size of losses of power circuit and the value of efficiency of inverter, which the high current inverter is able to reach.}
